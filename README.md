# Project-Game-SpaceWar
# Created for College Project


Modules/Libraries needed : Pygame, Random, Math (also mixer from Pygame)

I searched Google for learning about functions available in Pygame library.
I watched a video on YouTube implementing working of game Tetris.
But I wanted to make a game of my choice and my passions.
So I created this game 'Space War', simple but interesting.

I have explained most code working functon in main.py as comments.

Hope you like it.
Thanks!!!
